/* NOTE: The message ID is globally unique across all messages in the whole
 * program (i.e. on all nodes). This seems wasteful but it allows a
 * DATA_RAW message to use the same ID as the associated message, even
 * when:
 *
 *   1) The DATA_RAW messages are responses to different message types sent
 *   by the same node, e.g. the first is in response to a MessageDmalloc
 *   from a slave and the second is in response to a MessageDataFetch. To
 *   ensure that these DATA_RAW messages do not have the same ID and type
 *   (DATA_RAW), it is most convenient to make all messages sent from the
 *   same node have different IDs.
 *
 *   2) The DATA_RAW messages are sent from the same source to the same
 *   destination, but they are associated with messages sent in opposite
 *   directions, e.g. the first accompanies a MessageDmalloc from the
 *   master and the second is in response to a MessageDataFetch. Since the
 *   message IDs are allocated on different nodes they could easily
 *   collide.  It could be solved using different DATA_RAW types (for
 *   DMALLOCs in both directions, data fetches and data sends) or a flag
 *   saying whether the DATA_RAW is in the same or opposite sense as the
 *   original message, but both of these seem unnecessarily complex.
 *
 * Uniqueness of IDs is important for two reasons:
 *
 *   1) MPI message matching. The field for the message ID in the MPI tag
 *   is 24 bits, but it only needs to be unique among messages in flight at
 *   the same time. Hence overflow is not important. This assumes an 8-bit
 *   message type field, which could be cut to e.g. 5 bit if needed.
 *
 *   2) Extrae instrumentation. The Extrae ID needs to be globally unique,
 *   but it is of type long long. The id field in the Message type is 32
 *   bits and could easily be extended to 64 bits if it becomes a problem.
